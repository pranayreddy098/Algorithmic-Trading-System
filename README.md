# Algorithmic-Trading-System

The project seeks to develop a completely automated system with real-time trading ability in finance markets via technical means. The primary role of the algorithm is to locate trading opportunities via history-based OHLC (Open, High, Low, Close) data-driven breakout patterns, entering the trades at the optimal times, and managing the exits with pre-specified profit targets and stop-loss levels.

Written in Python and deployed onto trading terminals via APIs such as Breeze Connect, the algorithm constantly monitors market data, reads price action, and makes rapid, fact-based decisions autonomously. The system incorporates live trading and backtesting capabilities, enabling traders to deploy strategies over historical data and track performance metrics such as overall profit and loss (PnL), number of wins, and risk-reward ratios before they are run on live markets.

Efficiency, precisionness, and flexibility are the priorities of the project, allowing traders to customize strategy settings, control risk, and size across multiple instruments. Visualization functions are also included to allow users to understand results and refine strategies with time.

Overall, the project integrates technical analysis, automation, and real-time data processing to offer a powerful instrument for modern algorithmic trading and investment decision-making.
